# Leak-counter
A memory leak detector/counter implemented via a shim that intercepts calls to malloc and free

Memory leak tools are important in languages like C and C++ where memory management is done primarily by the developer
(as opposed to Java where it's handled automatically by the JVM)

This library demonstrates data structure management and understanding of lower level processes
